# Macro

## Requierement
- requieres Pygame2.0 (1.x probably works too)

##Launching and playing with the program
- Edit the parameters in the top of integration.py for customize your simulation
- Start integration.py and enjoy.

##Making your own map
I highly recommand to use paint.net for this one 
- RED (255,0,0) are for wall
- GREEN (0,255,0) are for exit
- Grey (n,n,n) are for people density, (0,0,0) equals to a density of 1 , (255,255,255) equals to a density of 0 (probably the worst choice of logic, but it's way easier to manage cause paint.net background is white)
